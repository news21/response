    <p>Road and bridge projects are expected to make up one of the biggest chunks of the jobs created in the stimulus package. Below, youâ€™ll find a chart of more than 5,800 projects that have been approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Once given the green light, states can put the projects out to bid, contract them and begin construction work. So far, about 2,300 projects are under way.</p>
    <p>Help us find out how much progress has been made on these projects by participating in our <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/spotcheck/">Stimulus Spot Check</a>.</p>
